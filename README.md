  - Calculated Columns  
  - Charts (Bar, Column, Combo)



## 📌 Key Insights

- Electronics had the highest product counts, but often came with lower average ratings.
- Products with higher discounts often received more reviews, showing a possible link between discount and customer engagement.
- Most products fell in the ₹200–₹500 price range, with the highest potential revenue observed in categories with both high ratings and high review counts.
- Some categories offer deep discounts, but their average ratings are not necessarily higher, suggesting price cuts alone don’t guarantee customer satisfaction.


## ✅ Recommendations

1. Target categories with high review counts and high ratings for promotion — these products build trust and convert better.
2. Use discounts strategically: Products with 50%+ discounts attract more reviews, but not always better ratings.
3. Focus marketing on products in the ₹200–₹500 range — it’s the sweet spot where customer engagement is high.
4. Track potential revenue by category to prioritize inventory and ad spend.
5. Consider improving products with high visibility but low ratings through better customer focused marketing , descriptions, or support.
